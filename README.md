# Html Is A Programming Language (HIAPL)

This is for all you doubters that said it wasn't. Guess what, it is now.

I can finally put HTML on my resume. I'm sure all the kids at school will be astonished at my exceptional HTML programming skills :DDD


## Usage (why??)
Download `src/hiapl.js` locally and add the following line to your html file:
```
<script type="text/javascript", src="path/to/hiapl.js"></script>
``` 

Some hand-written examples are provided under `examples/`.
> Viewer discretion is advised.
